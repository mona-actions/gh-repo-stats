# Get Repository Statistics

**GitHub CLI** extensions are repositories that provide additional `gh` commands, and this **GitHub CLI** extension can help you find information about your repositories in your organizations.
This information outlines the underlying **GitHub** `metadata` associated with your repository. This information is key to understanding how long a migration of the data from one instance of **GitHub** to another will take.
When the extension is run to completion, you will be presented with a visual table, or `*.csv` file to parse for all relevant information.

## Prerequisites

- **GitHub CLI** installed by following this documentation: <https://github.com/cli/cli#installation>
- Operating system that can run shell scripts(*bash/sh*)

You need to either export these environment variables:

| Environment Variable name | Value                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GITHUB_TOKEN              | GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with `admin:org`, `user:all`, and `repo:all` permissions |
| GHE_URL                   | GitHub URL or GHES URL without HTTP or HTTPS. Defaults to `https://github.com`.             |

Or the script will prompt you to put in the relevant information.
