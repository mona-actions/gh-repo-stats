# Get Repository Statistics

`gh repo-stats` scans an organization or list of organizations for all repositories and gathers size statistics, key to understanding how long a migration of the data from one instance of **GitHub** to another will take.

## Quickstart

`gh repo-stats` was designed to work with GitHub.com as well as GitHub Enterprise Server 2.20 or newer.

1. Install [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
1. Install [jq]7https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)
1. `gh extension install mona-actions/gh-repo-stats`
1. `gh repo-stats --org <ORG_NAME>`
1. Profit! ðŸ’° ðŸ’¸ ðŸ¤‘ ðŸ’¸ ðŸ’°

## Usage

```shell
$ gh repo-stats --help

Usage: gh repo-stats [options]

Options:
     -d, --debug                   : Enable Debug logging
     -e, --extra-page-size         : Set the pagination size for subsequent, paginated GraphQL queries; reduce if timeout occurs
                                     Default: 50
     -h, --help                    : Show script help
     -H, --hostname                : The GitHub hostname for the request
                                     Default: github.com
     -i, --input                   : Set path to a file with a list of organizations to scan, one per line, newline delimited
     -o, --org                     : Name of the GitHub Organization to be analyzed
     -O, --output                  : Format of output, can either be "CSV" or "Table"
                                     Default: CSV
     -p, --repo-page-size          : Set the pagination size for the initial repository GraphQL query; reduce if timeout occurs
                                     Default: 10
                                     If a timeout occurs, reduce this value
     -r, --analyze-repo-conflicts  : Checks the Repo Name against repos in other organizations and generates a list
                                     of potential naming conflicts if those orgs are to be merged during migration
    -rl, --repo-list               : Path to a file with a list of repositories to scan, one per line, newline delimited
     -t, --token                   : Set Personal Access Token with repo scope
                                     Default: token for hostname via gh auth token
     -T, --analyze-team-conflicts  : Gathers each org's teams and checks against other orgs to generate a list of
                                     potential naming conflicts if those orgs are to be merged during migration
     -y, --token-type              : Type of Personal Access, can either be "user" or "app"
                                     Default: user

Description:
  Scans an organization or list of organizations for all repositories and gathers size statistics for each repository

Example:
  gh repo-stats -o my-org-name
  gh repo-stats -o my-org-name -H github.example.com
```

## Permissions

`gh repo-stats` uses the permissions of the authenticated accounts setup with [`gh auth login`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth_login) or [environment variables supported by `gh`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_help_environment).

The permissions needed by `gh repo-stats` depends based on `-y, --token-type`:

- `user`: `admin:org`, `user:all`, and `repo:all`
- `app` with [GitHub App server-to-server token](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#server-to-server-tokens) with `Read-only` permissions to the following:
  - Repository Administration
  - Repository Contents
  - Repository Issues
  - Repository Metadata
  - Repository Projects
  - Repository Pull requests
  - Organization Members

## Output

`gh repo-stats` produces either a visual table or `*.csv` file containing detailed information about various records within repositories.
